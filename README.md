# D-Crypter

Studied multiple encryption algorithms and then constructed them in python language for the task of encrypting and decrypting different texts. The program for the encryption/decryption algorithm was written from scratch by studying the different algorithms mentioned in the project and how the encryption/decryption mechanism worked for them.

The algorithms currently implemented are:
 - Affine
 - Atbash
 - Beaufort
 - Caesar
 - Morse
 - Nihilist
 - Playfair
 - Polybius
 - Vigenere

Worked with 20+ to create social media automation bots which provided services like moderation, account automation, data collection etc. Worked with different social media APIs like Reddit, Discord, Telegram etc. Maintained a 5 star rating on the platform consistently. Also occasionally created bots capable of gathering and analyzing data related to multiple stock tickers from various subreddits.
