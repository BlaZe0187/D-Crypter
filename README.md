# D-Crypter

Studied multiple encryption algorithms and then constructed them in python language for the task of encrypting and decrypting different texts. The program for the encryption/decryption algorithm was written from scratch by studying the different algorithms mentioned in the project and how the encryption/decryption mechanism worked for them.

The algorithms currently implemented are:
 - Affine
 - Atbash
 - Beaufort
 - Caesar
 - Morse
 - Nihilist
 - Playfair
 - Polybius
 - Vigenere
